      "I, too, was at Ribfest. A rib cooker singles out some young guy wearing a white \"Where's the beef?\" T-shirt, standing off to the side. He says \"Hey buddy! That T-shirt ain't going to stay white for long\" as he points to his immaculately clean white apron, confusing those watching the exchange. The young guy says \"oh, I won't be *eating* any ribs\", and honestly his emphasis of the word *eating* creeped me out a bit, but whatever. So the cook huddles with associates and seem to come to some type of agreement and calls back over to the young guy \"Hey Buddy! Come here a minute!\" So he walks over and the cook turns on a loud white noise machine and we can't hear what they're saying. After a lot of emphatic hand waving, head nodding &amp; shaking, and some frantic scribbling and erasing on a white board, the young man walks over to the rib line (which is pretty long at this point since no one's been serving ribs). Everyone in line does a triple-take as the man takes his place in line, and the whole line is now murmuring to each other trying to make sense of it all. Someone finally incredulously asks \"What could the cook *possibly* have said to you to convince you to eat after you already declined one single time?!?\" The man smiles and says \"Well you see, I'm a VEGAN and can't eat meat, so the cook had offered to clean off the grill and make me some scrambled eggs instead.\" And one of the people in line says \"I didn't know they had scrambled eggs! I want that\". Others joined in \"Me too!\" \"I'll pay double!\" \"Triple!\" \"Money is no object!\" It was pandemonium. Another man stands in line with very puzzled look on his face. The line continues to swell as more people hear the rumor of scramble eggs and eventually all the Vegans at Ribfest make their way to the line. Finally, the puzzled man speaks up, \"Excuse me, I know this is none of my business, but do you mean vegetarian?\" The original white shirt guy gives his own puzzled look in return. So the puzzled man clarifies \"Well it's just that you said you're a vegan but you're about to eat eggs, which are an animal product - plus I think there's probably milk in it too if they're doing it right\" Someone else shouts \"And vanilla extract!\" And the puzzled guy says \"Yeah, maybe. But that's not an animal product. Anyways, I think maybe you meant vegetarian rather than vegan, since it sounds like you don't eat meat rather than all animal products?\" White shirt: \"Vegan, vegetarian, what's the difference?\" Puzzled guy: \"Um, well, I *just* explained the difference. You know what? Never mind; it's none of my business anyway.\" Then someone pipes up \"Won't the egg mixture just run through the grill?\" \"Maybe they have a skillet?\" someone replied. \n",

      "2) Mechanics is basically reaction time similar to gun skill.  All that you listed is relevant with one additional important note.  In Dota you acquire two resources: gold and experience.  You get these resources in three ways, killing creeps, killing enemy heroes, and killing towers.  In the early game killing creeps is the most important way to get these resources. The mid lane is as close at it gets to a fair fight (its a neutral lane not closer to either teams base and historically was played as a 1v1 contest) so there is a lot of contesting over last hits (also known as CS).  So people that find success in the mid lane tend to have really good reactions to win these 1v1s.  Also a lot of mid heroes are \"flashy\" with fast movement based abilities.  So you usually want your most mechanically talented player located there.\n",

      "3) The offlaner is probably the most vulnerable (its sometimes called the hard lane) since you are usually playing 1 vs 2 or 3 heroes.  But mid and the mid tower are often a very important early advantage and the focus of a lot of action early on in the game.  Since you can teleport to towers and they give vision the mid tower (with its neutral central location) is a very important objective to open up space on the opponents side of the map.\n",

The nice thing about Dota is that there aren't really fixed positions for how you set up your lanes.  Every team will send 1 hero to each lane, but what you do with your two supports depends on draft and strategy.  You can go aggro and send them all to the offlane, you can have 1 in the safe lane and 1 roam, etc.  \n",

You and baby both will be fueled off your stored fat (which is the purpose of it).

Payment methods: Bitcoin or USD equivalent. Affiliate program: 10%-5%-2%. Here's the link to join this opportunity and like I always say, I am not a financial adviser thus, you are investing into these things at your own risk.

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase \"Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

I sense that even in myself sometimes, and I don't like it. Some things are self-evidently wrong, ignorant, and hateful. But the vast majority of things about which people disagree are not that way. I don't see a lot of people on either side who seem interested in increasing the level of nuance to their opinions. I also feel that there is a chilling effect in much of public discourse. I don't even like the guy, but by merely talking about him and not just bashing him, I feel like I'm likely to get downvotes. I don't care about internet points, but I do think there's pressure to agree or be silent. That would just be one exceedingly silly example. The left does it to the right.

I think the Christian tradition gave societies a toolkit. I believe that any tools from that kit that still have value will be retained, and to hell with the rest.

I'm squarely in the left on the American political spectrum, but I sense more and more that there is a tendency to dismiss anything, whether an idea, a study, or a person, that conflicts with progressive views as so self-evidently wrong, ignorant, and hateful as to not even deserve consideration. I sense that even in myself sometimes, and I don't like it. Some things are self-evidently wrong, ignorant, and hateful. But the vast majority of things about which people disagree are not that way. I don't see a lot of people on either side who seem interested in increasing the level of nuance to their opinions. I also feel that there is a chilling effect in much of public discourse. I don't even like the guy, but by merely talking about him and not just bashing him, I feel like I'm likely to get downvotes. I don't care about internet points, but I do think there's pressure to agree or be silent. That would just be one exceedingly silly example. The left does it to the right. The right does it to the left. That's probably always been so. But I feel increasingly the far left does it to people who basically share their goals.\n",

I do not share his opinion that the whole thing has an underlying ulterior motive of destroying Western civilization.

      "I was in a relationship with a guy for two years, we lived together and everything. Long story short, he wasn't the guy for me and I broke up with him and moved back in with my parents. I totally didn't expect his reaction, I thought he would shrug and pretend he didn't care. He did care. He cried his eyes out and begged me to stay, asked me over and over to please stay and give him one more chance. Even clung to me and kept saying please please please, I'll do everything different! It was the hardest thing I had to do in my life, walking away and purposely hurting someone to save my own happiness. It was the hardest but also the best decision I have ever made. It has been years since then and I'm sure he had a hard time at first. There was just nothing I could do for him, every conversation we had just gave him hope we would be okay again. I'm glad he could rely on his parents for support. I felt so guilty at first, especially because I started dating someone new a lot earlier than him. However years later we are both in relationships with different people who suit us much better. I honestly think he would agree now that it was for the best. This was my personal anecdote, I hope it gives you hope that down the line everything will be okay 😊 the heavy feeling and the guilt will lessen over time, you are not responsible for his happiness. You are not obligated to stay with him so he is comfortable. Sending you strength and happiness and if you want to talk I'm here! \n",

I read recently he had less than 100 yards rushing for his ENTIRE career. So even if Marino was a better passer than Elway, I'd consider his lack of mobility to be a significant disadvantage. Also--and this probably isn't all his fault necessarily-- he played for two Super Bowl winning coaches and only had one SB appearance.  Elway took three Reeves-coached squads to the Super Bowl that had no business being there. That's how good he was.  Quick who was Elway's top receiver on those teams? Who was his running back? I can't remember and I actually WATCHED those teams! \n",

Back then no woman would dare pull some revenge crap like Leslie did, because no male power player then would ever allow a woman to have that kind of power.  Sorry ladies but rape revenge like what Leslie did, however empowering and entertaining, was not only not practical but due to the culture of the time would never have happened. So yeah that was the big BS exclamation point on the ending of that show, that and the ridiculous amount of money Netflix spent on it.  The Get Down deserved to get cancelled.  Overall though, with all of Netflix's other hit shows, one miss like the get down shouldn't hurt their overhead much at all.  They are still hitting it out of the park with shows like Luke Cage and Stranger Things, as well as a lot of their other original shows and the ones they currently got in development.

      "I have to agree with a lot of the critiques here.  The pilot showed a lot of promise, but the show just went down hill from there.  The show had so much potential to be an accurate portrayal of the origins of hip hop and how the culture of the 70s in NYC really influenced not only a generation but changed the landscape of the music industry in general.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But sadly they just didn't portray it very realistically and it wasn't, like someone else said, raw or real enough.  And don't get me started on the whole rape scene where Leslie Lesgold forces Jackie Moreno to go down on her because he once coerced her into giving him a blowjob and then fired her way back when she interned for him.  Really?  Such BS and so completely unrealistic.  I lived through that era, women got used and sexually exploited all the time and not just in the music industry.  Back then it was the unofficial and deeply repulsive status quo that in order for a woman to get a ahead, pardon the pun, she had to give head and much more. If she didn't play that game she got black listed and her career was over.  \n",

People still complain about no Camus/Xander repeat because they started after that point. There's no way everyone has the same goal of collecting every unit at 4* level 40 when there's literally no point to that either. The only thing the game actually tracks is 5* level 40s. F2P have limited barrack space and limited supplies of feathers, so there's nothing in game even wanting you to do this. I've upgraded literally 7 total units to 5* with the amount of Feathers I've gathered since I started playing and I don't have enough to upgrade someone to 5* right now. And two of those were 4* s I pulled and wanted to build up, like a ton of other users would want to do with their favorite units, which would be a much more important goal for them than raising their Virion to 4* level 40 using the Feathers and stamina they would've otherwise put into a +10 Selena or something. \n",

With Verona's horrible scoring record I doubt they'll score today but if they do it'll only be 1 and Torino have more than enough quality to get 2+.

As far as injuries go Inter are only missing Cancelo who hasn't played in a month anyway.

      "Brighton have struggled for goals this season, they're scored 5 in 6 (3 goals coming against West Brom) and have only scored 1 away from home so far.

      "So I have a long term success story. My mother has borderline personality disorder and spent my entire childhood vacillating between the extremes of every emotion, within a short time frame. It was horrible because I never knew what to expect and had to be constantly on guard. She would go from praising my intelligence to telling me I was a desperate whore worth nothing all while making me feel responsible for her emotions. She essentially gaslighted me my entire life and I still struggle with feeling confident in my own memories. There was other stuff too, sexual abuse at home but I have very few memories of that, thankfully, since what I do have is bad enough. Thanks to this I had horrible coping mechanisms. I have no idea how my husband put up with me for the first couple years. Eventually, I managed to escape my childhood horrors and realized I needed help because I wasn't ok and I wanted to be the best version of myself possible for my own daughter. So, I found a therapist I was comfortable with and put in the time and work to learn how to process what I lived through and cultivating positive coping mechanisms in addition to finding a combination of medicines to help me remain stable instead of teetering into depression and the more obsessive, controlling tendencies I get when stressed. It took several years to get to where I am now but I'm finally happy, steady, and comfortable with/proud of who I am. I even managed to forgive my mother for how she treated me. I know she has a problem and is miserable so I can understand WHY she does things but I will never have a relationship with her. I just refused to allow her to have any impact on my life anymore because she stole enough from me already, I'm not going to allow her to do it now that she's out of my life. Being angry and resentful wasn't hurting her at all (in fact, that allows her to be the victim, which she loves) but it was eating me up so I decided to let it go. Now I have a strong, successful marriage (12 years and still going strong), I'm a great mother, and have a career that allows me to support my family. I feel like I'm finally the person I was always meant to be and I love this version of me.\n",

We would put new bolts in prior to the race weekend. I also noticed yesterday when the track was drying that the asphalt joints are visible down the centre of the track - this tends to indicate that asphalt is starting to fail.

It even dumps you directly into Inferno when you talk to the characters after killing Diablo the same way that after killing Malachai it would open a portal to Cruel/Merciless. But Inferno was, from the first moment, ludicrously hard to the point where grinding white mobs for trash drops for weeks until you could kill skeleton king, to grind him for weeks to try and get strong enough for the next boss, etc, was completely normal. The final difficulty didn't feel optional any more than Nightmare/Hell did. Comparatively, Uber Atziri is very clearly super hard mode, since to get to her you have to grind regular Atziri a lot, and the game doesn't push that you're 'supposed to' fight her.\n",

      "Welcome to the Chiefs Kingdom!  The most recent generation of Chiefs Teams (Vermeil era, to the Herm Edwards Era, to the Todd Haley era, to the Romeo Crennell era, which brings us to the Andy Reid era) have basically been a middle of the tier or bottom dwelling team, mostly due to terrible defense. We've had a long string of underperforming in the playoffs. Andy Reid has coached the best teams of this group, but he's also had the best players. We've never really drafted a QB high, and we've mostly gone after FA QB's like Joe Montana, Trent Green, Matt Cassel, and Alex Smith. Which is why fans are really excited for Patrick Mahomes, who we traded up to take no.10 overall this year. Most fans expect him to start next year as Alex Smith's replacement. KC teams of basically every era have been known for producing great running-backs, due to a history of having great offensive line play.  At the end of the Vermeil era, we had a potential 4 Hall of Famers along the offensive line (out of 5 lineman) - including Willie Roaf, Bryan Waters, Casey Wieggman (not a HOF'er but could potentially be one), and Will Shields. This offensive line blocked for some of the greatest runners in Chiefs history, including Priest Holmes and Larry Johnson, who were basically money in the bank when it comes to scoring TDs on a weekly basis. KC Chiefs Stadium is known as \"Arrowhead Stadium\" and is a premier tailgating experience, which not all stadiums have. We also have the best mascot ever in KC Wolf. \n",

The policy of subprime mortgages (which was the bad choices that banks made), meant that mortgages were given out to those who shouldn't have recieved them because they don't make enough to pay them off. This was just a very risky move that banks thought would be fine because they can just sell off the house. The problem with that is, when a lot of people default on their mortgage and the banks try to flip a lot of houses, the prices of those houses fall, in the case of the GFC, by a lot. This meant that the banks lost a lot of money. This was an indicator that a crash could happen, along with the increasing house prices that were just too expensive for a large amount of Americans. It's really hard to tell when the crash will happen, because we just can't tell where the tipping point is, but you can predict that a crash will happen although not many actually did predict that a crash would happen so it caught the public by surprise.\n",

The great depression caused really bad unemployment as in 25% unemployment bad so it was a very damaging and severe economic crash. It lasted from 1930 until WW2 when employment picked up again. WW2 was what got us out of the great depression. 2008 wasn't as bad and I'm fairly sure we won't experience a great depression level crash again since banks are backed now by the fed who wouldn't let a crash of that scale happen (they'd do what they did in 2008 again) and congress would back them too.\n",

Their Vidal Icewine is great and they make a dry red Baco Noir that is fantastic and is cheap as hell (~ 8 CAD). Those would be my stops. Jackson Triggs is nice but skipable and Peller I thought was just bad. Don't skip going to see the falls while in the area. It's cheesy and touristy but it is completely mesmerizing and awe inspiring\n",

Jerry and Nibbles once stole food from a banquet Tom was supposed to be guarding, effectively getting him *executed* at the guillotine. They didn't care either, they just ate their food and sauntered away knowing full well they just got a guard killed. On top of that, Tom has even rescued Jerry from certain doom at the hands of other foreign foes. \n",

      "&gt; Deep Purple is an English hard rock band that formed in Hertfordshire in 1968. Together with groups such as  Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, they're considered as heavy metal pioneers. Especially influential to later metal bands were Ian Gillan's powerful screams and Ritchie Blackmore's virtuoso solos. Deep Purple were also very influential to progressive music as well, with their style evolving over the years and incorporating a variety of genres from art rock to blues to psychedelia and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; The Early Days:\n",
      "Deep Purple's early output ranged from energetic rock (such as their cover of Joe South's \"Hush\", which became an iconic radio hit that climbed to #4 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart) to strongly classically influenced pieces (such as \"April\", a fan-loved gem from their third album). Their first few albums contained very long solos, such as those on the band's covers of \"Hey Joe\" and \"I'm So Glad\". The appeal of the more heavy, arena-friendly tracks from the group brought them considerable success in the U.S., setting them apart from many English contemporaries, particularly in their 1968 debut album 'Shades of Deep Purple'.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; After their third album, founding member and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore in particular felt the band should move in a harder direction. He additionally felt that then singer Rod Evans and bassist Nicky Simper were incapable of working in that direction. Both were therefore let go, and Blackmore had them replaced with singer Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover from pop rock group Episode Six. What is now thought of as the classic Deep Purple line-up came to be when keyboardist Jon Lord and drummer Ian Paice came in, this line-up being often labeled as 'MK II' (in contrast to the previous 'MK I' with Evans and Simper). \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; The first output of this revamped group was a mixed electric and orchestral album with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, 'Deep Purple in Concert', with the centrepiece being Lord's \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\". The 1969 release earned some international commercial success despite (or, prehaps, because of) its novetly, reaching #149 on the Billboard 200 chart. The whole project was reputedly initiated after idle chat with the band's manager about the possibility led to him book the orchestra and give the inexperienced composer a deadline to produce the work of a public concert. \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; Following on from this unusual venture were four very influential studio albums over the next four years: 'Deep Purple in Rock', 'Fireball, Machine Head', and 'Who Do We Think We Are?', and the live album 'Made in Japan'. Aside from earning widespread critical acclaim, the band's influence spread as many new hard rock groups looked to their sound. American audiences ate the English group up, with album after album rising up the Billboard 200 chart.\n",
      " \n",
      "Though this lineup still recorded some songs with a lighter, almost pop-like tone such as \"Strange Kind of Woman\" and \"Black Night\", the influence of their new blood and the impetus this provided to the existing members pushed the band strongly in the direction of heavy rock music. Songs such as \"Speed King\", \"Child in Time\", and the massively popular \"Smoke on the Water\" showed the fiery spirit of the group, with Deep Purple achieving sustained international commercial success.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; In 1973, creative tensions led to Gillan and Glover leaving the band, being replaced by previously unknown singer David Coverdale and ex-Trapeze bassist/singer Glenn Hughes. This new lineup continued the success of their predecessors, recording the albums Burn and Stormbringer, and further successful tours and live albums. However, Blackmore became disenchanted with the increasing funk direction he felt the band was taking and left to form Rainbow (a name inspired by the stage set when they performed at the California Jam music festival) with former members of Elf, who had previously toured with Deep Purple as a support act. \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; The band recruited former James Gang guitarist Tommy Bolin and recording Come Taste the Band. It was on the 75/76 tour that the tensions within the band really came to the surface, finishing with their final performance in Liverpool in March 1976, where Coverdale resigned and the band ceased to exist. Tommy Bolin died of a heroin overdose in December 1976 whilst on tour with his solo band. \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; Coverdale went on to form Whitesnake, with Paice and Lord joining Tony Ashton to form the short-lived Paice, Ashton and Lord before they too joined Coverdale in Whitesnake. Hughes completed a solo album but spent most of the 70s and 80s fighting drug addiction which he finally overcome in the 90s and has since produced a string of solo albums. \n",

      "In 1984, Deep Purple's best-known second lineup (Ian Gillan, Jon Lord, Ian Paice, Roger Glover, and Richie Blackmore) reunited to produce the albums Perfect Strangers and The House of Blue Light. Tensions returned however, and Gillan was fired and replaced by Joe Lynn Turner, formerly of Rainbow. This lineup only lasted for one album, Slaves and Masters, before Ian Gillan returned again for The Battle Rages On. Blackmore subsequently departed the band for good while touring in support of this album, being temporarily replaced by Joe Satriani. During this time, many archival live albums of the original Deep Purple lineup were released, such as Scandinavian Nights (a 1988 release of a 1970 concert) and King Biscuit Flower Hour (a 1995 release of two 1976 concerts) \n",

Vor allem geht es um Primzahlvermutungen und im weiteren Sinne um die Frage, wie Addition und Multiplikation zusammenhängen. DIe Wahrheit ist nämlich,  dass es beängstigend wenig Muster in dem Verhältnis der beiden gibt. Als Beispiel versuch mal, herauszufinden, wiie die Primfaktorzerlergung der Summe zweier Zahlen von der der Summanden abhängt. Generell ist dieses Gebiet gut,wenn du über eine gute Intuition für Zahlen verfügst, und wahrscheinlich noch dem am nächsten, was normale Leute unter Mathematik verstehen. Eine Stufe abstrakter ist Gruppentheorie, die die konkrete Struktur der natürlichen Zahlen mit dem abstrakteren Begriff der Gruppe ersetzt. Irgendwer bekanntes hat mal sowas gesagt wie \"Gruppentheorie ist abstrahiertes Rechnen\" oder so, was den Nagel auf den Kopf trifft.Sie ist aber eines der wichtigeren Gebiete abstrakter Algebra. Generell ist Zahlentheorie meistens die Disziplin, für die gewaltige mathematische Theorien geschaffen werden, die aber im Gegenzug kaum etwas verwertbares an den Rest der Mathematik zurückgibt. Die Sachen die sie zurückgibt laufen aber oft über Gruppentheorie, weil sich viele Sätze über die natürlichen Zahlen recht einfach auf Gruppen verallgemeinern lassen. Der nächste Schritt nach Gruppen sind Ringe, und hier fängt Algebra an, geometrische Bedeutung zu gewinnen, was algebraische Geometrie hervorbringt. Algebraische Geometrie in ihrer heutigen Form ist erst im letzten Jahrhundert entstanden und nimmt eine Art sweet Spot in der Mathematik ein, weil sie geometrisch in ihrer Intuition ist, abstrakt in ihrer Formulierung und hochkomplex in ihrer Theorie. Einer der großen Boni von AlgGeo ist, dass abstrakte algebraische Eigenschaften eine geometrische Entsprechung erhalten und umgekehrt. Eine Maschinerie, die In AlgGeo extrem wichtig ist, zunehmend aber Bedeutung in jedem einzelnen Gebiet der Mathematik erlangt ist Kategorientheorie. Ich kann dir nur raten, einen ernsten Blick auf Kategorientheorie zu werfen (unten Literatur), weil sie für den richtigen Verstand so etwas wie ein goldener Schlüssel zu jedem einzelnen anderen Gebiet sein kann und mehr und mehr zu einer Grundsprache von Mathematik wird. Hier möchte ich kurz das Verhältnis zu Mengenlehre, der anderen Grundstruktur der Mathematik, eingehen. Mengenlehre gibt uns eine Antwort auf die Frage \"Können wir eine mathematische Struktur finden, von solcher Größe und Komplexität, dass wir jede andere Struktur darin ausdrücken können?\". Kategorientheorie dagegen versucht die Frage \"Wie können wir eine Sprache schaffen, die es uns ermöglicht, die essentiellen Eigenschaften einer Konstruktion herauszukristallisieren, ohne uns mti den Details beschäftigen zu müssen?\" zu beantworten. Ein gutes Beispiel ist die Definition eines Vektorraums: Wir könnten uns ohne Probleme einen Vektorraum in der Sprache der Mengenlehre definieren, der Prozess wäre nur unheimlich anstrengend und würde keinen Erkenntnisgewinn hervorbringen. Auf der anderen Seite braucht die Definition eines Vektorraums mit Katgeorientheorie nur einen Satz und ergiebt vollkommenen Sinn, wenn du die allgemeine Theorie dahinter kennst. Deshalb unterstreiche ich die Bedeutung von Kategorientheorie so: sie wirkt in vielen Bereichen wie ein exponentieller Bonus, den du durch einen Haufen initialer Energie erwerben kannst, und je früher du das tust, desto mehr \"Zinsen\". Aber Mengenlehre und Kategorientheorie stehen in gewisser Weise für verschiedene Herangehensweisen an Mathematik, und ich bevorzuge die zweitere sehr stark, weil mir vorkommt, dass die erstere in vielen Fällen einfach aus Sturheit an unintuitiven Herangehensweisen festhält und sich so das Leben selber schwer macht (jeder, der mal ein Lehrbuch axiomatischer Mengenlehre gelesen hat weiß wovon ich rede). Dennoch halte ich es für wichtig zu erwähnen, dass es ein Fach gibt, universelle Algebra, das tief in der Mengenlehretradition ist und für viele Strukturen andere Beschreibungen liefert als Kategorientheorie. Besonders spannend ist Modelltheorie, die Mischung von universeller Algebra mit Logik, die teilweise verblüffende Ergebnisse hervorbringt. Aus kategorientheoretischer Sicht ist Modellthorie eines der wenigen mathematischen Teilgebiete, die noch immer keinen Sinn ergeben.  Auf der exakt gegenüberliegenden Seite zu Algebra liegt Topologie: das Studium von Formen, ohne Rücksicht auf exakte Messungen. Das bekannte Beispiel ist, dass ein Doughnut topologisch genau gleich aussieht wie eine Tasse mit Griff. Während es in Algebra um Rechenoperationen geht, geht es in Topologie um abstrakte Räume. Umso schöner ist es zu sehen, dass sie eigentlich (aber nicht wirklich) genau dasselbe sind. Darum geht es in algebraischer Topologie, ein Gebiet, das, ähnlich wie algebraische Geometrie, an einem sweet Spot von Anschaulichkeit, Abstraktion und Komplexität liegt und tiefe Verbindungen zu Kategorientheorie hat.

Ersatz goods, like synthetic rubber and limited trade for valuable resources (via neighboring neutral countries or with blockade runners) can only get you so far.

What followed was the Hundred Days Offensive in the West, retaking all the ground lost and braking through the Hindenburg line, with new offensive in the Balkans from the Greek territory, which led Germany to sign the armistice in November 1918.\n",

If you are interested in deck building I would look at the mythic spoiler database. they kinda have the majorty of all the cards in each set in a nice display you can just read through.

It's clear to me that SpaceX just wants to get the damn thing built soonest, so they have decided to go with whatever can possibly work, not the optimums.

      "Yeah, it was a very good set of predictions. It's clear to me that SpaceX just wants to get the damn thing built soonest, so they have decided to go with whatever can possibly work, not the optimums. So we have a higher mass fraction for the BFS because thats feasible now, 9m diameter because it fits in the current facilities, and using the \"Scaled\" raptor at a lower pressure rather than the original monsters, because they KNOW that works right now since they have been scorching the grass at mcgregor with it.\n",

       "'BAHIA COCOA REVIEW\\n  Showers continued throughout the week in\\n  the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early\\n  January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,\\n  although normal humidity levels have not been restored,\\n  Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.\\n      The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.\\n      Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags\\n  of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93\\n  mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems\\n  that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the\\n  arrivals figures.\\n      Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how\\n  much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has\\n  practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates\\n  around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there\\n  are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,\\n  middlemen, exporters and processors.\\n      There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit\\n  for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in\\n  obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.\\n      In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have\\n  sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.\\n      Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350\\n  cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.\\n      Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and\\n  only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to\\n  1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.\\n      New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with\\n  June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs\\n  under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs\\n  per tonne FOB.\\n      Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at\\n  4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.\\n      April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July\\n  at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at\\n  2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and\\n  2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.\\n      Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,\\n  Uruguay and open ports.\\n      Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for\\n  March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times\\n  New York Dec for Oct/Dec.\\n      Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible\\n  currency areas.\\n      Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325\\n  and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New\\n  York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York\\n  Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith\\n  said.\\n      Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags\\n  against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88\\n  crop.\\n      Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to\\n  be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after\\n  carnival which ends midday on February 27.\\n  \\n\\n'"
